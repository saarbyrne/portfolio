        "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My journey as a designer has been shaped by a variety of experiences, from working with top sports teams at Kitman Labs to developing healthcare products at IBM. Over the years, I’ve come to understand that leading a design team in the software industry is not just about managing work—it's about cultivating a culture of clear communication, creativity, collaboration, and a strong focus on impact. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building a Foundation with Clear Communication and Focus</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my current role at Kitman Labs, where we work with sports leagues and teams such as the NFL and Premier League, the importance of clear communication is paramount. Our products are used by elite professional teams to keep athletes at their peak. Design decisions must be rationalised, communicated and aligned with both user needs and business goals. These decisions have an impact for the user but also the business and the communication of the rationale behind those decisions determines the design teams ability to deliver good product.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why this matters: The stakes are high when designing tools that impact athlete performance and health. Clear communication ensures that all team members and stakeholders are aligned with the overarching objectives, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and enabling us to deliver product that meets the high expectations of our clients. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I like to strongly focus on making our goals explicit and shared across the team, minimising the risks of assumptions leading to misaligned outputs. Coupling this with regular check-ins allows the team to stay up to date and responsive to any changes or new insights that arise. This approach helps us maintain a collaborative environment where ideas can be shared, tested, refined, and implemented swiftly. A goal oriented approach is very helpful. Agreeing with the team short and long term goals helps us keep focus and concentrated. But, like all plans and goals, we do have to regularly question them so as not to miss an opportunity or misdirect.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fostering a Collaborative Environment</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Collaboration across the squads and disciplines is imperative for building a great experience. The integration of design and development is crucial for creating products that serve the real-world needs of users. This has required me to draw heavily on the \"Design Thinking\" methodology, which emphasises empathy, ideation, and iterative development. I find this a simple framework, which has its drawbacks, to implement and use as a starting point with the more junior team members. As the designer and engineer levels up, their own sense of process develops, and the aim then becomes about setting basic expectations and principles. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why this matters: Collaboration between designers, developers, and other stakeholders ensures that the final product is both innovative and technically sound. By fostering an environment where cross-functional collaboration is the norm, we can tackle complex problems from multiple perspectives, leading to more robust and user-centered solutions. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Balancing Creativity with Constraint</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the key challenges in leading a design team is balancing the creative freedom of designers with the practical constraints of software development cycles. At Kitman Labs, where our timelines are often dictated by the competitive sports seasons, this balance is critical.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Creativity needs structure to be effective, especially when working within the fast-paced environment of software development. With a small team a Kitman Labs, covering multiple products. We have centralised the team and created two approaches to product and innovation work, 1) Full Support and 2) Consultation. We generally push squads to use a consultation when working on simple work, which can be like an assembly line of work. The designer acts as quality assurance and gives advice from afar. The squad uses the design system templates and rules to constrain direction. While a full support model is used for high impact strategically important work. Here the designer has full grace to attack the problem space and work through understanding the context, the user, the stakeholder needs and ideating strongly. These two levels free us up but allow for oversight and a retention of quality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Managing Remote Teams </h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Given the global nature of our work, managing remote teams has become a significant part of my role. With a team spread across different time zones, tools like Figma and Slack are essential for maintaining productivity and team cohesion. However, I’ve found that these tools alone are not enough—building a strong team culture, based on interpersonal connections and a common direction is key.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why this matters: Studies from the Harvard Business Review emphasise that remote teams thrive when they have strong social connections and a shared sense of purpose. To address this, I like to have regular online workshops and informal check-ins, this goes some way to help maintain the team’s morale and foster a sense of belonging, even when we’re miles apart.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

The 2 types that interest me will centre around critical thinking, specifically, reflecting on reality, and an approach to life or in our case design.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Reflection on reality&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>An approach to life (or design in this case)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Definition Of Design</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To establish a foundation for my theory, I will begin with three definitions of design. These will ground my thinking and allow for a deeper understanding of my perspective.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Herbert Simon defines design as \"the process by which we transform existing conditions into preferred ones.\" This definition is strong because it starts with the current state and highlights design as a change agent aimed at creating more desirable conditions. However, it also implies that design always aims to improve the world, which isn't always the case. Design outcomes can be positive or negative, and intentions can vary.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Design, as a verb, is an act everyone engages in—it’s about determining change. What sets professional design apart is the strong intention, purpose, and structured approach behind it. Professional designers follow formal processes, gather information, make sense of it, ideate creatively, and have ethical considerations. This is similar to the difference between a layperson diagnosing a cold and a doctor doing so. The doctor, with their extensive training and credentials, is trusted over the layperson. The layperson could be correct in any instance, but over time the average will decline. Professional designers, likewise, design with a level of expertise and ethical responsibility that lay people do not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Charles Eames once described design as \"a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.\" This definition appeals to me because it emphasises intentionality and organisation, applicable to various design fields (communication, urban, UX, interior, etc.). It subtly introduces the concept of conscious decision-making, crucial for professional designers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Victor Papanek, in his book \"Design for the Real World,\" defines design as \"the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order.\" This blends elements of Simon's and Eames’ definitions but stops short of specifying the reasons or methods for imposing order.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These three definitions provide a base for understanding design as done by the general population versus practised by professional designers. A professional designer consciously and purposefully determines changes for the better, guided by ethical principles. In contrast, non-professional design tends to be more haphazard. Professional designers should adhere to ethical standards, akin to the medical profession, aiming to improve the world through their work. Therefore, Herbert Simon's normative claim that design should transform existing conditions into preferred ones holds significant weight in the context of professional design.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Approaches</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Herbert Simon's Rational Approach: Herbert Simon, in \"The Sciences of the Artificial,\" advocates for a methodical, systematic approach to design. He views design as a problem-solving activity that relies on logical processes and scientific principles. This approach is grounded in the belief that following structured steps can lead to optimal solutions. Simon’s underlying thinking is reflected in frameworks like the Double Diamond and Design Thinking and for this is popular in business contexts because it offers a clear, predictable path that can be easily understood and implemented. It is particularly effective in scenarios where variables are known, innovation is not the primary goal, and the environment is relatively stable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Donald Schön's Reflective Practice: In contrast, Donald Schön's perspective, detailed in \"The Reflective Practitioner,\" emphasises an experiential and iterative approach to design. Schön introduces the concepts of \"reflection-in-action\" and \"reflection-on-action,\" where designers continuously reflect on their actions during and after the design process. This method values learning through doing, where insights are gained and refined through practice. Schön's approach is dynamic, focusing on the ongoing nature of learning and adaptation. It is particularly suited to complex, uncertain environments where creativity and continuous improvement are essential.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Both Simon's and Schön's approaches are valuable in their own right. Simon’s structured methodology provides clarity and efficiency in well-defined contexts, while Schön’s reflective practice offers flexibility and adaptability in more ambiguous situations. As a design professional, understanding and integrating both approaches allows for a more comprehensive and responsive design process, tailored to the specific needs and challenges of each project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My Working Definition</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hesitate to write anything as a definition because I think the lack of an agreed definition is a strong point for design. It can be different in different contexts. It means the profession is constantly exploring and pushing. But for the sake of fun and the idea behind this blog being that I engage and form opinions, I took a punt:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Designing is the cycle of defining /redefining and structuring of conditions with the aim of meeting a specified outcome/s.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is where I am right now. Based on the above writers, and others, and my experiences. The elements that resonated with me were:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Design as an iterative learning process which tends toward an outcome / mission</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The realisation that design cannot guarantee an outcome, rather it's the setting up of conditions. Its like the Brian Eno perspective, 'Think like a gardener, not an architect: design beginnings, not endings'.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Having freedom to choose between approaches, depending on the context, knowns and unknowns. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practice</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As an aside I often split work into these two categories. Complicated and complex. Complicated can be done using Herberts Simons approach by a more junior designer. If the steps and rules are followed a level of success is achieved. Whilst work which is new and unknown I categorise as complex and this lends itself to Schön's approach. In this way, work can be allocated and expectations determined beforehand. Sometimes complicated work is complex and sometimes complex work is actually complicated, but that is just a matter of recategorising and changing expectations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

        "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aim of this is piece is for me to describe my thinking on business as an entity in the world, why I see it as a vessel, and the implications of that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Concept</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I see the concept of a business as a vessel for an aim. I see a service or product as a developed idea which intervenes in the world and has impact, ideally the aim set out by the business. The aim for me is explicit, it is to improve the world in some way. It is not profit. I see profit as a rule of capitalism, something the business must do to survive. It’s like the liver, it's important to keep it healthy, you can’t live without it, it produces energy and metabolism. But, it is not the aim. That is like saying the aim of the person is to produce energy and regulate blood sugar levels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why do I start with this? Because I think the reasons behind things are important, specifically when it comes to decision making. If you think of the business as a body, you understand the need for it to survive, to stay healthy and strong. You also understand that in a modern society, it needs meaning and direction. This gives fulfilment and gratification. In this way the business is a body of people with needs for survival, but also a deep need for fulfilment.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Depending on the environment and the health of the body, survival is more or less difficult to achieve. In a modern, well developed society, survival is less of an issue. There is an abundance of food. You do not need to grow and farm your own food. Shelter is readily available. Water is treated and provided. Modern society bypasses the need for survival by provisioning the basics.&nbsp;This can be the same in business. If you get an investor, capital or you can keep your survival needs low you can meet your survival needs. Basically if you can become sustainably profitable, you can meet your survival needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The issue with the basic requirements of bodies is that the required survival needs are much higher in a modern developed society. The expectation of a 4 bedroom house, a nice car, lunches and dinners out, and live entertainment as a need, means the definition of survival is much higher. In business this can be the same. Often businesses get lost in what a business needs to do to survive, the basic needs of each department accumulate and sum to a greater need than is actually necessary. The simplification of life expectations and business expectations with regard to survival can have a huge impact on the quality and ease of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simplify</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lower your needs. Simplify everything. Everything you do needs to have impact, it needs to relate to the aim and add some value to the business. Understanding whether something adds value is easy, does it have an impact on the aim and how much? Ask yourself, can we do without this? If I remove this process or tool from the budget, what happens? What are the alternatives, is there an easy work around? Still unsure? Give it a score if you can't measure it accurately. Which you won't be able to do. Now compare things. Remove the bits that are not necessary. Keep pruning, always pruning and refining.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adaptation</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Running is an excellent activity to keep the body healthy. Resistance training is an excellent activity to keep the body healthy. Some people can be afraid to do either because they are afraid of pain, pain through embarrassment or pain through physical exertion. Adaptation is controlled pain over time. Slight pushing of the boundaries. Reduce the expectation of making big changes, instead concentrating on shorter term consistent improvements. This way the body adapts and you never experience a larger pain. But, you need to be comfortable with pain and change. If you want to improve your muscles and last the distance, you need to be willing to meet the pain and realise the benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The wrong pain is when this is extended and the body receives no benefit and overall aim is not being moved toward. This is the same as in business. Pain over time equates to a negative to the body, to the whole. It is detrimental. You need to understand your body and your business. You need to know when the signal of pain is good and when it's detrimental. These are often confused. Like a runner only running hard, never understanding the benefit of slow runs, and how it can improve oxygen use and glycogen stores. In business you see a lack of focus or misdirected approaches. Wasted energy on unimportant things that actually have a negative impact on the business. Always pruning, always refining.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I say ideally because some initiatives are at odds with one another and have to be traded off. So it's the overall utility and the business intention which decide which initiative to pursue in this scenario. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some Design Moats:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Design system:</strong> this speeds up and automate large portions of systematic design and development work. Its a cross discipline win. Hard to replicate by other companies if done well. It helps reduce the size of the, keep it lean and easier to manage. It speeds up GTM time. And there are many other benefits, including a standard level of quality.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Production cost reduction:</strong> This is associated with the above point, which could be considered a sub point to this. Other forms of production cost reduction is the use of integrated tooling. In design this is usually a tool like figma which is not starting to integrate in things like confluence, jira, notion, and more importantly dev environments. All in one tools are useful, but sometimes looking at other one off tools is beneficial in speeding up production, cutting the costs and retaining quality. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Attractive and aesthetically appealing UI:</strong> this can be huge. A strong competitive advantage in B2B particularly as its largely punted as a nice to have. I would argue, if you have a design team, this is very cheap. When demoing or showing off product, this has the single most unquantifiable impact. The first thing to build trust and customers judge is the UI. Whether they say it or not.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Strong workflows based on user needs (efficient and useful): </strong>this is the main thing a UX team should be doing. Efficient gains for the user and keeping them happy, keeping the price point competitive too, will drive the advantage. The price and quality go hand in hand though. It cant take years to GTM for the sake of quality.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Well organised product:</strong> IA is often overlook, but it relates to the previous point. People will unconsciously be put off by poorly organised software. They need to intuitively get around the product. This is hard to do. And takes time. It is a opportunity, as not many design teams, let alone non design teams, get it right.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Good onboarding:</strong> getting a user onboarded and using the product makes or breaks it success. Easy and intuitive user flows and set up will help push the advantage. Again, something that particularly B2B struggles with and a great opportunity. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Constant value release:</strong> shorter periods between releases, that is not to say I am advocating for shit being shipped, can create a freshness to the product. For this to work, minor changes and improvements constantly shipped has a great impact, but newer, bigger features I think need more thought. Often business release shit and point to lean theory as a way of saying its ok. After a certain level of maturity and depending on the client, this wont wash.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many moats because there is competitive advantage to be found everywhere. These are just a few. Process and planning areas two other places to explore for example</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

        "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is the design strategy I use for Kitman Labs after we downsized the team based on a need for the company to mature and to start turning a net profit. It's based on Roger L Martins book Playing to Win. The framework is summarised here: <a href=\"https://fs.blog/playing-to-win-how-strategy-really-works/\">Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works</a>. I use this framework because of all the frameworks, models and thinking Martins work is by far the most practical and thought through. Another thing which strikes me is in the way he uses the word strategy, it could easily be swapped with the word design. He sees strategy as trade offs between what to do and what not to do, it's a choice as he repeatedly writes. I see design in the same way. Strategy and choosing where to play and win is a creative endeavour as is design. Another thing I like is the title. I am competitive. I want to win. But I want to do it as a team and for the right reasons. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Context</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Given the scenario, where my team was cut by half, 10 to 5, in a year. We still wanted to try to deliver a quality product experience. We looked at our competitor, specifically a company called Teamworks. They had expanded their design team. We were the industry leaders when it came to product experience, quality of our UI and workflows. Given they were updating their product, the signal being the hiring of 10 product/UX/interaction designers versus us who reduced our size to 5, we knew we had to try and still deliver a standard.

The aim here is to track user stories across discovery and design work, similar to development work. Once that is part of the planning process we can start to account for when and who we will conduct user research with. We can look at the market, we can look at competitors. All the things that would normally be done, but operationalised and formalised, giving it a backing and transparency that elevates the design team. This is by no means perfect, there are still issues with moving between the discovery phase and the development phase, but it is far better than not having discovery and design work in the planning process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"block-a8353918-f0f5-495a-a5f6-a4cc458068f7\">Leveraging Agile Methodologies for Flexibility</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-9b4881f9-6aaf-4ddc-989b-bf8d8becb388\">Including discovery and design in the agile and scrum frameworks is key to having design recognised and having a seat at the table.

The design role at software companies is about expertise in interaction design, visual design and user research, but the design role is also about collaboration. Everyone is a designer, everyone is involved in the overall design of the experience. The design team looks to work with others closely to deliver a great brand and product experience, and to push the agenda and perspective of experience as the primary driver of value for users. I push the design team to work with others and I try to create an environment where others feel welcome to share their ideas and creativity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-05fe598f-3535-497e-a1a4-a38e08c481c8\">Collaboration across teams is essential for successful project management. At Kitman Labs, I work closely with customer support and product teams to ensure that our designs address real user pain points. This cross-functional collaboration is informed by the principles of Service Design, which emphasises the importance of considering the entire user journey.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-f6e25dae-80e1-4461-8820-622c4605b4f8\">Why this matters: Service Design teaches us to think holistically about the user experience, considering not just the interface but the entire journey. By collaborating with customer support and product teams, we can gain a deeper understanding of user needs and ensure that our designs are truly user-centred. This approach leads to more effective and impactful products that meet the needs of our users and support our business objectives.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-92dc7993-eaad-40ac-b8c9-72ed38c2cc3c\">Ezio Manzini’s book clearly articulated the point, <strong><a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4460/Design-When-Everybody-DesignsAn-Introduction-to\">Design, When Everybody Designs</a></strong>.

I find this is broader than design thinking in its nature. It cuts across disciplines and provides a set of methods which allows me to bring together the user experience and the back office services which cater to each touchpoint. This also drives the added benefit of actually bringing people together and not working in silos, couple it with a strong goal and desire to improve something and you can have a winning strategy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

It also pulls in subjective feedback I log through a simple web interface—how tired I felt, how sore, any notes about injuries or how training actually went, separate from what the numbers said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of that gets sent to Claude Sonnet 4.5. I designed the prompt to act like a rehab specialist, it knows to balance objective metrics with how I actually felt, to prioritise injury reports and fatigue signals even when the biometric data looks good. Claude analyses the patterns, figures out training load distribution, assesses recovery, and spits out a plan for the next week that accounts for both the data and my experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Why Email</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I choose email as the delivery method for pure convenience and for fun. I could have built a dashboard or an app, but email removes friction. The plan shows up in my inbox every Sunday morning as a clean HTML email. I can read it on my phone. I also got to learn how to connect different systems to create a bigger system, a full workflow. One of the issues in work is the lack of scope, the constant descoping of work. I wanted a bit more here, because I was in charge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Technical Challenge</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hard part wasn't any single piece, it was getting systems that weren't designed to talk to each other to actually communicate. Garmin's API uses OAuth 2.0 with session tokens that expire after about a year, so the system needed token management. The data comes in different formats: JSON for summaries, FIT files for detailed activity data (which need parsing), XML for some wellness endpoints. Each type needs different transformation before it hits InfluxDB.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The n8n workflow has over a dozen nodes doing different things: calculating date ranges, formatting HTTP requests with auth headers, parsing responses, merging data streams, building prompts with dynamic variables, handling errors, rendering HTML emails. It has to handle missing data, API rate limits, network failures, bad responses, all without breaking the chain. All of this can be partially done with AI, the coding portion and the guidance, but you still, as a human, have to stitch it all together. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Claude integration required the most thinking. I had to design the prompt so it understands the rehab context, respects constraints, and produces output that can be reliably parsed. The prompt needs to be specific enough to get useful output, but flexible enough that the AI can use judgment based on the mix of objective and subjective data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Adding Subjective Feedback</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I realised the biometric data wasn't enough. I needed a way to capture how I actually felt. So I designed a simple web interface with sliders for energy, fatigue, soreness, motivation, plus text fields for training notes and injury reports. Using Cursor and Claude, I put together a Flask app that writes directly to the same InfluxDB database, so subjective and objective data live in the same timeline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":618,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-07-at-13.24.21-710x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-618\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I extended the n8n workflow to pull that feedback alongside the Garmin metrics, and updated the Claude prompt to prioritise injury reports and high fatigue signals even when the numbers look okay. Now the system understands not just what the data says, but how I actually feel, which matters a lot in rehab.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can build complex technical systems without deep coding knowledge. The barrier to entry is much lower now with AI coding tools. By understanding how existing tools talk to each other, Docker, InfluxDB, Grafana, n8n, Claude and thinking through the user flow and what I wanted from each component, I designed and developed and end to end flow. I just planned and worked with a good AI model initially, Sonnet 4.5, and found the right tools for each point, figured out how to connect them. The result is more robust and maintainable than an app would be. Each piece can be updated independently, I can customise Grafana without touching data collection, modify the n8n workflow to add data sources, refine the AI prompt to improve recommendations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":622,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-07-at-13.29.30.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-622\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everything's on GitHub as a fork of the original Grafana project: code, configs, documentation.

They understood the problem, the need for better workforce insights, career pathway analysis, equality and diversity metrics, compliance tracking. But they couldn't imagine what the solution might look like, or more importantly, what value it would deliver. This was an ongoing conversation, I found out later, and had actually started years earlier. The organisations had wanted to look at the topic but couldnt bring themselves together to get organised.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is where traditional product development often falls short. We could have spent months building a fully functional system based on assumptions, only to discover we'd missed the mark. Or we could have created static mockups that failed to convey the depth of interaction and insight the platform would provide. Neither approach would have helped our stakeholders understand how this could transform their understanding of the UK coaching landscape.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Approach</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":569,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-06-at-22.13.25-1024x639.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-569\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead, we took a different path. We spent the majority of our time not building, but sculpting a narrative. What story did we need to tell? What interactions would make the value proposition clear? What visualisations would make abstract concepts tangible? We knew the story was just as important as the prototype and the two needed to work together. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We asked: if a coaching association executive could click through a dashboard and see, in real-time, how career pathways flow from entry-level positions to head coach roles, would that change their understanding of the problem? If they could filter by region, gender, ethnicity, and see the demographic patterns across 8,450 coaches, would that make the need for better data collection obvious? If they could explore data completeness across seven partner organisations with a simple RAG status system, would that demonstrate accountability in a way that spreadsheets never could?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Foundation: A Design Prototyping Kit</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The speed to build was dictated by our existing Design Prototyping Kit, essentially a mini version of Kitman Labs' core product, distilled into a reusable template.

He'd found an ML model that had been trained on social media images to detect image quality. The interesting bit was baked into the training data: the dataset included which images actually got liked by users. So the model could tell you if an image was technically good quality and whether similar images had been liked in the past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was vague. But we were both interested in doing something with ML. I'd worked on AI projects at IBM Watson Health and at Kitman Labs (Risk Advisor), so I was curious about the space. More than that, I was interested in working within constraints. We weren't capable of training a model ourselves—that was beyond our capacity. But we could work with what was available. The model was already trained. Our job was to hack around it and see what we could create.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instagram came later. The name came later.

The technical setup was straightforward: we used Apple's Core ML framework to run the model on-device. No server calls, instant feedback, user privacy preserved. The model would analyze a user's photo for quality and predict engagement based on patterns it had learned from its training data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The design work was about making that prediction feel useful rather than harsh. Nobody wants an app telling them their photo is rubbish. We built features that emphasised progress and community: \"Your Journey\" tracked improvement over time, the \"Anonymous Wall\" let users get peer feedback, category-specific predictions (selfies, landscapes, food, animals) provided context, and one-tap Instagram sharing made it easy to post photos that scored well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We launched in September 2017 and found genuine traction. The app reached 50,000+ users, analysed over 3 million photos, and saw unexpected uptake in markets like Colombia and Russia around 25,000 downloads across those regions. Users reported engagement improvements, influencers started using it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With that traction, Aram pitched it to DIT's New Frontiers programme.

First, an AI agent analyses fixtures, objectives, and focus principles to create a periodised timeline, assigning load classifications and mesocycle phases that respect the science of periodisation. Second, the system populates each session with appropriate drills from an enriched library, ensuring variety while maintaining alignment with the coach's selected principles of play. This was near end of day when I realised this. That, what I needed was actually an 'agent' which works through a set of steps in the background, not just a general AI model. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The initial interface didnt include any major inputs, just a date range, adjust focus sliders that must total 100%, and select up to seven principles of play from attacking, defending, and transition categories. Behind the scenes, the system loads fixtures from Supabase, analyses the timeline, and generates periodisation that looks at both load management and tactical preparation The technical AI implementation uses Google's Gemini model (we use this in Kitman Labs) with a two step generation process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":644,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-07-at-21.02.42-1024x462.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-644\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Feedback Checkpoint</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After building the prototype, I presented it to internal ex-practitioners and product managers at Kitman Labs. Feedback came in 2 forms, the output quality was poor, so the plans weren't usable in practice, and secondly, the users wanted more input up front.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The problems were obvious, regardless of the feedback. The model was too general, it wasn't truly agentic. Instead of reasoning through periodisation science and making contextual decisions, it applied generic thinking patterns. The longer the time horizon for the periodisation plan, the poorer the prescription became further into the future. Plans that started with reasonable load distribution degraded into nonsensical patterns as the AI lost coherence over extended timelines. I even added a dashboard to track the output breakdown, so I could have a birds eye view of what was being produced and audit it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":649,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-07-at-21.03.18-1024x777.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-649\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was also a lack of coherence in the output. Many of the prescribed exercises and loads were duplicated. The AI didn't want to expend energy, so it lazily output as much duplication as possible rather than creating variety. Sessions that should have been distinct felt repetitive. The system wasn't learning from what it had already generated, it was treating each session independently without maintaining awareness of the overall plan structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Iterating on Feedback</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The initial feedback revealed another critical issue: users wanted more control over the plan generation process. The internal feedback suggested that more input at the initial portion of the prompt to create the periodisation plan was necessary. Users wanted more determination over the plan, not leaving it totally up to the AI. This may have been due to the poor quality output though. I wonder if they would have cared if the output was excellent?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was a design problem, not just a technical one. I had optimised for automation, the AI would take the inputs and generate everything. But coaches didn't want to cede that much control. They wanted to guide the periodisation strategy, not just set objectives and hope the AI got it right.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":646,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-07-at-17.07.30-1-1024x557.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-646\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In response, I added an initial input modal that allowed coaches to provide more detailed guidance before the AI generated the periodisation plan. This gave users more determination over the plan structure while still leveraging AI for the heavy lifting of drill selection and session construction. The modal captured additional context about training philosophy, preferred load patterns, and specific constraints that the AI could then incorporate into its periodisation reasoning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This iteration taught me that even when building AI-powered tools, users need to feel in control. The AI should augment decision making, not replace it entirely. The initial input modal became a bridge between human expertise and AI capability.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":647,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://saarbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-07-at-21.02.55-1024x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-647\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This failure taught me several critical lessons about building AI-powered tools.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>First</strong>, there's a difference between an AI that generates content and an AI agent that reasons through problems. The model I used could generate text that looked like periodisation, but it wasn't actually reasoning through the science of load management, fixture importance, or tactical progression. It was pattern matching, not problem solving.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, coherence over time is harder than I anticipated. Generating a single session is straightforward. Generating a coherent six-week plan where each session builds on previous ones and prepares for future fixtures requires maintaining state and context that the model struggled with. The degradation in quality over longer time horizons exposed this limitation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, the model optimised for efficiency, not quality. When generating multiple sessions, it defaulted to duplication rather than variety. This revealed that without explicit constraints and feedback loops, the AI would take the path of least resistance. I needed to build mechanisms that enforced variety and coherence, not just prompt for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, user needs are more specific than I understood. Coaches don't just need periodisation, they need periodisation that reflects their specific philosophy, respects their fixture schedule, and maintains coherence across weeks. The generic model couldn't deliver that specificity. It needs a RAG or LoRA, or some augmentation, unless you want to train your own model. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Finally</strong>, a prototype that demonstrates a concept is different from a tool that solves a problem. The Planning Advisor shows what's possible, but it doesn't solve the actual need. To move from prototype to product, I would need to either constrain the problem significantly, use a more sophisticated agentic architecture, or accept that the AI provides suggestions that coaches refine rather than complete plans they execute directly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This prototype isn't finished, and it's not refined. But it served its purpose: it taught me what doesn't work and why. The next iteration would need agentic reasoning, state management across the planning horizon, explicit variety constraints, and a clearer understanding of where AI assistance adds value versus where a human in the loop is necessary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

What we quickly found was that this process of setting goals as a method for developing players is a common approach.

(English football team), have a lot more time and staff available to work with each of their players, thus the goal setting process is very curated and progress is regularly reviewed every 6 weeks with a number of staff members.

Generally, we found many teams were not as developed as Chelsea F.C. Nothing was operationalised at many of the teams we spoke with. For example at Saracens Rugby (English rugby team) and the Ducks (American hockey team), each staff member had a different approach to working with players and conducting the review process, even within the teams. At Chelsea F.C., though, things are rigorous, thought out and the process is standardised. They are also considered the benchmark for player development in sport. This highlighted an opportunity to give guidance and reflect such a process in our software and offer it to customers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {\"align\":\"full\",\"style\":{\"spacing\":{\"padding\":{\"top\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\",\"bottom\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\",\"left\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\",\"right\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\"},\"margin\":{\"top\":\"0\",\"bottom\":\"0\"}}},\"layout\":{\"type\":\"constrained\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\"><!-- wp:group {\"align\":\"wide\",\"style\":{\"spacing\":{\"blockGap\":\"0\"}},\"layout\":{\"type\":\"constrained\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><!-- wp:group {\"style\":{\"spacing\":{\"blockGap\":\"var:preset|spacing|10\"}},\"layout\":{\"type\":\"flex\",\"orientation\":\"vertical\",\"justifyContent\":\"center\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"className\":\"is-style-asterisk\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center is-style-asterisk\">Reinforcing Loops</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\",\"style\":{\"layout\":{\"selfStretch\":\"fit\",\"flexSize\":null}}} -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Below is a breakdown of the As-Is.

In an effort to learn about the topic we arranged a number of working group calls with medical practitioners in the NFL these ran over the course of a number of months. As a company, Kitman Labs provides generalised software for all its customers. There is the ability to tweak what is shown and not shown, but customisation is generally kept tight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, in this case we wanted, and it was agreed with the NFL, that we would provide them software but we would retain the ability to make decisions based on our wider user base i.e. soccer, rugby, cycling, cricket, boxing etc. With this in mind we took a decision to work with other sports and medical practitioners to understand their needs. In total we talked to 100s of practitioners and went onsite with 15 NFL teams, the IRFU, Chelsea FC and numerous other teams to get feedback on our ideas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns --></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"40px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"style\":{\"layout\":{\"selfStretch\":\"fit\",\"flexSize\":null}},\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center is-style-default\">Discovery</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {\"align\":\"wide\",\"style\":{\"spacing\":{\"blockGap\":\"0\"}},\"layout\":{\"type\":\"constrained\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"var:preset|spacing|40\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:columns {\"align\":\"wide\",\"style\":{\"spacing\":{\"blockGap\":{\"top\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\",\"left\":\"var:preset|spacing|60\"}}}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide\"><!-- wp:column {\"verticalAlignment\":\"top\",\"width\":\"60%\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"flex-basis:60%\"><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"className\":\"is-style-asterisk\"} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading is-style-asterisk\">Key Learnings</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Rehab begins the day of injury.

Kitman Labs is a start up, in this context it would be silly to stop all product work to implement this update, it would take too long, so we rolled out the changes incrementally over time. Targeting low hanging fruit first, then targeting important areas and then some pages were never touched, as we never got to them. There was no dedicated squad on this, there were only 2 squads at the time. The plan was more so a commitment by all of us to try achieve this, and utilise any down time or align pieces of product work with updates, so for example if some was working on the administration area for a release they might do an extra piece of work to chip away at the changes. And we would cross that off the list of things to do, so more Kanban than sprint based. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The implementation is still ongoing, we have aligned a lot of the product around this sitemap, but as new areas, unforeseen at the time, have been added, the original work is watered down. And so it's an ongoing process and we are doing another piece of work to relook at this I.A.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"layout\":{\"selfStretch\":\"fill\",\"flexSize\":null}}} -->\n<p>The primary aim of the project was to determine an updated information architecture. We had done that, so felt happy that we identified where wanted the product to go and had set a path. But what was also great and helped, was the inclusion of multiple different stakeholders across the organisation and the strong input from users. This helped push the uptake after the 'vision' was set, helped us determine a good plan and get buy to do the work. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another positive outcome was that we clearly needed a content strategy and documentation specifically around how we use language. Everyone knew that instinctively but we hadn't done much to rectify the need until this project. So, due to us being a small start up, did what any good designer does with little time, we commandeered <a href=\"https://polaris.shopify.com/content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Polaris Content Guide</a> and we use that as the basis for our work. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns --></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->",

This was part of a bigger Discovery phase, conducting <strong>generative research</strong>. All of the staff talked openly about how they need help engaging their athletes.
