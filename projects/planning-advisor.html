              For a Hackathon, I wanted to create an end to end flow for performance coaches to create detailed, periodised training plans. Performance coaches at elite sports teams face a problem creating detailed, periodised training plans due to time pressures. I wanted to automate that using AI.

              Performance coaches at elite sports teams face a problem creating a detailed, periodised training plan that accounts for the complexity of modern football. You have fixtures to consider, player load to manage, principles of play to emphasise, game models, and the balance of preparation and recovery. Most sports scientists and coaches spend hours manually constructing these plans, balancing competing priorities with limited time and incomplete information.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              During Kitman Labs' hackathon day, I wanted to solve this by creating an end to end flow where a performance coach could input their objectives and have a detailed, intelligent plan generated automatically. A complete periodised plan that an AI creates based on the actual data of the club and the specific aims of the coach.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              I also wanted to learn how to create tool that utilises AI. The hackathon format would force quick, focused decision making and expose what actually mattered versus what I assumed would matter. My experience with AI coding tools is as good as anyones, so this challenge was doable.

              My aim was to get an end to end, using our design system (a version of MUI) and I wanted to emphasise the technical side of things. I knew having a clean UI was not going to happen. So I parked the idea of perfection. I approached this as a design problem first, then a technical one.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              The core insight was that plan generation needed to happen in two distinct layers. First, an AI agent analyses fixtures, objectives, and focus principles to create a periodised timeline, assigning load classifications and mesocycle phases that respect the science of periodisation. Second, the system populates each session with appropriate drills from an enriched library, ensuring variety while maintaining alignment with the coach's selected principles of play. This was near end of day when I realised this. That, what I needed was actually an 'agent' which works through a set of steps in the background, not just a general AI model.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              The initial interface didnt include any major inputs, just a date range, adjust focus sliders that must total 100%, and select up to seven principles of play from attacking, defending, and transition categories. Behind the scenes, the system loads fixtures from Supabase, analyses the timeline, and generates periodisation that looks at both load management and tactical preparation The technical AI implementation uses Google's Gemini model (we use this in Kitman Labs) with a two step generation process.

              The initial feedback revealed another critical issue: users wanted more control over the plan generation process. The internal feedback suggested that more input at the initial portion of the prompt to create the periodisation plan was necessary. Users wanted more determination over the plan, not leaving it totally up to the AI. This may have been due to the poor quality output though. I wonder if they would have cared if the output was excellent?
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              This was a design problem, not just a technical one. I had optimised for automation, the AI would take the inputs and generate everything. But coaches didn't want to cede that much control. They wanted to guide the periodisation strategy, not just set objectives and hope the AI got it right.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              In response, I added an initial input modal that allowed coaches to provide more detailed guidance before the AI generated the periodisation plan. This gave users more determination over the plan structure while still leveraging AI for the heavy lifting of drill selection and session construction. The modal captured additional context about training philosophy, preferred load patterns, and specific constraints that the AI could then incorporate into its periodisation reasoning.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              This iteration taught me that even when building AI-powered tools, users need to feel in control. The AI should augment decision making, not replace it entirely. The initial input modal became a bridge between human expertise and AI capability.

                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800 font-bold">AI generation vs reasoning</p>
                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">There's a difference between an AI that generates content and an AI agent that reasons through problems. The model I used could generate text that looked like periodisation, but it wasn't actually reasoning through the science of load management, fixture importance, or tactical progression. It was pattern matching, not problem solving.</p>

                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800 font-bold">Coherence over time is hard</p>
                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">Generating a single session is straightforward. Generating a coherent six-week plan where each session builds on previous ones and prepares for future fixtures requires maintaining state and context that the model struggled with. The degradation in quality over longer time horizons exposed this limitation.</p>

                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800 font-bold">Optimising for efficiency, not quality</p>
                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">The model optimised for efficiency, not quality. When generating multiple sessions, it defaulted to duplication rather than variety. This revealed that without explicit constraints and feedback loops, the AI would take the path of least resistance. I needed to build mechanisms that enforced variety and coherence, not just prompt for them.</p>

                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">User needs are more specific than I understood. Coaches don't just need periodisation, they need periodisation that reflects their specific philosophy, respects their fixture schedule, and maintains coherence across weeks. The generic model couldn't deliver that specificity. It needs a RAG or LoRA, or some augmentation, unless you want to train your own model.</p>

                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800 font-bold">Prototype vs product</p>
                <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">A prototype that demonstrates a concept is different from a tool that solves a problem. The Planning Advisor shows what's possible, but it doesn't solve the actual need. To move from prototype to product, I would need to either constrain the problem significantly, use a more sophisticated agentic architecture, or accept that the AI provides suggestions that coaches refine rather than complete plans they execute directly.</p>
