          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">Design needs to advocate. I make the assumption, based on experience, that people still dont understand product / UX design. In making this assumption I need to then set an expectation on myself, to justify design. This feels horrible. But it is necessary for job security, not just my job, but my teams. Below is a general breakdown of value that design bring which I make front and centre for execs and other stakeholders. </p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">It also acts as focus point for the designers. It, in essence, provides the business help in understanding what activities design could and should be engaging in. These points are continuously reinforced through highlighting successes to the business and reinforcing links to how we keep production cost low whilst also maintaining this value production. It is important to set a foundation with these value drivers and to explicitly showcase when value is provided. This creates a moat around the team. As a manager that is part of my job. To protect the team and allow it to do its thing.</p>

<h4 ><strong>Design as a discipline or a practice at Kitman Labs offers value in the form of:</strong></h4>

<ol class="list-decimal list-outside space-y-4 ps-5 text-body-lg text-gray-800"><li>Customer engagement – user research, customer presentations, GTM material, RFP material</li>

<li>Discovery – user research, secondary research, competitor analysis, some google analytics, a way to understand the market and our user</li>

<li>Design – expertise in UI and Interaction Design practices</li>

<li>Collaboration – facilitation of collaboration between disciplines, specifically with PM and ENG and with user research participants</li>

<li>Product Experience – Overall quality of the product for users is drastically enhanced</li>
</ol>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">Below is a link I usually provide too. It's helpful to share external material to reinforce the value claims. This may need to be updated due to its publication date. But I do think it's still relevant. </p>
