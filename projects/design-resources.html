<h3 >Team and Staff</h3>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">I look to hire product designers. These designers have a strong knowledge of user research techniques, interaction design and visual design. Due to the approach being collaborative I see facilitation techniques as also being an ideal capability. My general aim is to find designers with a hunger for this type of end to end control who have potential to develop into the role. Creating a vision and project leadership are two other core capabilities.</p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">In terms of developing talent I have taken a strong interest in developing my methods using evidence based approaches. I find there is a lot of noise in business theory and many of the ideas are based on individual case studies and single observations. These are often not generalisable and so I look for material that is supported and researched to base my approach hiring, onboarding, managing and leading staff.</p>

<p id="block-e0a3bf7c-aba7-4622-9ce5-4b4a45d9d343">When I became a manager I needed a lens on how to approach the activities of a design manager. I initially adapted basic business and product management frameworks but none of these ever gave the level of specificity that I needed, specifically when it comes to design production management. There are many graphic design production management books, which are useful, but again, not enough for a B2B product design discipline. When I heard of DesignOps, and I realised it wasn’t a fad, I found it a great tool, toolkit and way of thinking for a new manager.<br>﻿</p>

<p id="block-22f93c5e-b032-4d44-a703-1d3e6f770c3d">Design needs to be involved in planning. User research needs to be involved in planning. How? It needs to be formalised and factored into the process. It is the Design team’s, and therefore the Design Manager’s role, to identify how that can happen.</p>

<figure><img class="w-full object-cover rounded-xl" src="/src/assets/blog/design-resources-2.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is dual_track-1024x451.png"/></figure>

<p id="block-19b587e8-7867-41a4-a4f2-9a9cca28f5eb">I have found that utilising a dual-track agile framework best allows for the integration of discovery, design, and development work. The aim here is to track user stories across discovery and design work, similar to development work. Once that is part of the planning process we can start to account for when and who we will conduct user research with. We can look at the market, we can look at competitors. All the things that would normally be done, but operationalised and formalised, giving it a backing and transparency that elevates the design team. This is by no means perfect, there are still issues with moving between the discovery phase and the development phase, but it is far better than not having discovery and design work in the planning process.</p>

<h3  id="block-a8353918-f0f5-495a-a5f6-a4cc458068f7">Leveraging Agile Methodologies for Flexibility</h3>

<p id="block-9b4881f9-6aaf-4ddc-989b-bf8d8becb388">Including discovery and design in the agile and scrum frameworks is key to having design recognised and having a seat at the table. Design needs to be involved in planning.</p>

<p id="block-8fcd4edd-1025-4ea6-915b-c63cf07eff81">Agile methodologies have been a cornerstone of my approach to project management. At Kitman Labs, we use tools like Jira and Asana to track our progress, but the real value comes from the processes that these tools support. Regular sprint planning and retrospectives allow us to stay flexible and responsive to changes in the project scope or user feedback.</p>

<p id="block-44329d58-8531-4692-84d6-7637c18fc334">Why this matters: Agile methodologies provide the flexibility we need to adapt to changing requirements and user needs. By embracing Agile, we can deliver high-quality designs that meet both user and business objectives, even in a fast-paced and ever-changing environment. This adaptability is crucial in ensuring that our products remain relevant and competitive.</p>

<h3  id="block-33467c2e-4970-4c3a-aef4-ca6e950710ee">Collaborating Across Teams - Co-Design / Service Design</h3>

<p id="block-db23ca96-ee20-4e5a-ae24-da54d9f9c650">I see Design as the driver of collaboration and facilitation of designing. The design role at software companies is about expertise in interaction design, visual design and user research, but the design role is also about collaboration. Everyone is a designer, everyone is involved in the overall design of the experience. The design team looks to work with others closely to deliver a great brand and product experience, and to push the agenda and perspective of experience as the primary driver of value for users. I push the design team to work with others and I try to create an environment where others feel welcome to share their ideas and creativity.</p>

<p id="block-05fe598f-3535-497e-a1a4-a38e08c481c8">Collaboration across teams is essential for successful project management. At Kitman Labs, I work closely with customer support and product teams to ensure that our designs address real user pain points. This cross-functional collaboration is informed by the principles of Service Design, which emphasises the importance of considering the entire user journey.</p>

<p id="block-f6e25dae-80e1-4461-8820-622c4605b4f8">Why this matters: Service Design teaches us to think holistically about the user experience, considering not just the interface but the entire journey. By collaborating with customer support and product teams, we can gain a deeper understanding of user needs and ensure that our designs are truly user-centred. This approach leads to more effective and impactful products that meet the needs of our users and support our business objectives.</p>

<p id="block-92dc7993-eaad-40ac-b8c9-72ed38c2cc3c">Ezio Manzini’s book clearly articulated the point, <strong><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4460/Design-When-Everybody-DesignsAn-Introduction-to">Design, When Everybody Designs</a></strong>. Everyone role is part designer, we need to embrace it as a discipline, the design of the experience is shared.</p>

<figure><img class="w-full object-cover rounded-xl" src="/src/assets/blog/design-resources-3.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is nng-service-blueprint-example-1024x879.png"/></figure>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800"><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link to reference material</a></p>

<p id="block-e17943f4-330b-445d-aaca-ee29c0fd2ce7">At the group level, cross squads, I utilise a service design approach. I find this is broader than design thinking in its nature. It cuts across disciplines and provides a set of methods which allows me to bring together the user experience and the back office services which cater to each touchpoint. This also drives the added benefit of actually bringing people together and not working in silos, couple it with a strong goal and desire to improve something and you can have a winning strategy.</p>
