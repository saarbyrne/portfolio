          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">As part of the <a href="https://iadt.ie/courses/critical-design-philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Critical Design Philosophies</a> course I recently did at the end of 2024, I spent some time looking at Democracy. </p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">I have wanted to give more time and space to things bigger than just software and design, to go back to what I have always loved, politics, justice, philosophy and democracy. To do so, I needed a bridge, something that logically and practically allows me to think about the topics again. In spending time looking at the spaces, the bridge I identified, or angle I have found, is in looking at Democracy from the perspective of design. In doing so I feel I have struck a cord within myself, something that allows for a unique viewpoint on Democracy.</p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">My aim is utilise design concepts, tools and language to frame an analysis of Democracy. I do not believe I will unearth anything new in an objective sense but rather subjectively it will allow me to understand the space and also to open up the possibilities of influence to other designers and creatives, who may also feel partitioned from what is now seen as a 'science' and therefore very formalised and professional. Realistically this is a personal goal which I hope has some value for others. In delving deeper into the why and what of this blog I have also narrowed further the longer term aims I have.</p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800"><strong>Aims</strong></p>

<ul class="list-disc list-outside space-y-4 ps-5 text-body-lg text-gray-800"><li>Document and share as a way of understanding Democracy from the perspective of design.</li>

<li>Ideally, promote the development of eGovernment practices in Ireland, with the idea and aim of it being the standard bearer for eGovernment and more generally democracy.</li>

<li>Develop a tool or range of tools to help achieve the above goal. </li>
</ul>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800"><strong>Here are some of the topics I wish to explore:</strong></p>

<ul class="list-disc list-outside space-y-4 ps-5 text-body-lg text-gray-800"><li>What is democracy? What do we mean by democracy? What are the flavour? What are the examples? Who are the key figures and thinkers? What is important and what isnt? What is the theory and what is the practicality? </li>

<li>What design can bring? Why can design and the way in which design works, help in the Democratic space? What is about design mentality that can help?</li>

<li>How can technology help in the democratic process? What is already on going? Where does it fall down? Where are the gaps? What, ideally, can it do? </li>
</ul>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800"><strong>ALT Democracy:</strong></p>

<figure><img class="w-full object-cover rounded-xl" src="/src/assets/blog/design-democracy-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-692"/></figure>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">My initial starting point is this look at alternative narratives in democracy. And their influence on political thought. This was created as part of my Critical Design Philosophies course: <a href="https://saarbyrne.com/leviathan">https://saarbyrne.com/leviathan</a></p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800"><strong>Polis UX upgrades</strong></p>

<p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">My next project, when I get time, is in flight. It's about updating the Polis app, which aims to unite people on democratic decisions at scale. Currently, the concept is good, but the UX is not so good. This is a theme with open source software.
