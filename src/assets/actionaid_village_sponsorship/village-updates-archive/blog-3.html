            <p>Mrs. Oroma Evelyn from the village of Owak in the district of Nwoya was one of the 40 women who received a heifer from the ActionAid 'Food for Thought' project which aims to improve the overall household income of poorer rural families. Oroma is 30 years of age and is married with five children, three girls and two boys. Her first born goes to school in primary five and is eleven years old while her youngest is still only a couple of months old.</p>

            <p class="credit"><strong>"My children are the source of joy and pride in my life,"</strong> Mrs. Oroma Evelyn </p>
	       
            <p>An excited Evelyn said, "Being orphaned at an early age I passed through various challenges and difficulties in my life. I was married at 16yrs and I guess this happened because I didn't have a family to care for me. Everything I do now is for my children and since I got married I've been trying to farm a small piece of land to provide for their needs.</p>
            
            <p> This has been hard as there is a huge gap in age from my eldest child to the youngest so for the last 11years I seem to have always been farming with a young child by my side. This was a difficult period of my life but in the last couple of years I have hope for a better life thanks to the support of our Irish supporters. I have benefitted from several trainings including family planning, livestock and agricultural management but what really transformed life for myself and my children was when I received a heifer which recently gave birth to twins. </p>
            
            <p>Before, I was earning 493,000 shillings or €145 a month from growing some vegetables in my garden This would barely allow me to buy food for my children but now with the 9 litres of milk I get every day, I have around 161,500 shillings or €47.50 extra a month.</p>

            <p class="credit">Mrs. Evlyne Oroma & her cows.<br><strong>"The heifer I received has changed our lives,"</strong> Mrs. Oroma Evelyn </p>
            
            
            <p>It might not seem like much money but it means that I am now able to meet the costs for two of my children to go to school even without financial support from my husband and I am better able to cater for our basic home necessities such as clothing, blankets and shelter.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you ActionAid for training me in agriculture and for also supporting me with a heifer for my family. This is a dream come true. The communities are crying out for this kind of support and I hope that ActionAid continues with their programmes as they are changing lives in my community and giving us the support we need to bring ourselves out of poverty.</p>
