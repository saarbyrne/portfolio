 Note:The below code is used to grab the fields Realex Payments POSTs back 
 to this script after a transaction has been processed. Realex Payments need
 to know the full URL of this script in order to POST the data back to this
 script. Please inform Realex Payments of this URL if they do not have it 
 already.

 Look at the Realex Documentation to view all hidden fields Realex POSTs back
 for a card transaction.

// Replace these with the values you receive from Realex Payments.If you have not yet received these values please contact Realex Payments.
$merchantid = "yourMerchantId";
$secret = "yourSecret";

// Below is the code for creating the digital signature using the SHA1 algorithm provided by PHP
// This digital siganture should correspond to the 
// one Realex Payments POSTs back to this script and can therefore be used to verify the message Realex sends back.
$tmp = "$timestamp.$merchantid.$orderid.$result.$message.$pasref.$authcode";
$sha1hash = sha1($tmp);
$tmp = "$sha1hash.$secret";
$sha1hash = sha1($tmp);

//Check to see if hashes match or not
if ($sha1hash != $realexsha1) {
	echo "Hashes don't match - response not authenticated!";
}

/*
 You can send yourself an email or send the customer an email or update a database or whatever you want to do here.

 The next part is important to understand. The result field sent back to this
 response script will indicate whether the transaction was successful or not.
 The result 00 indicates it was successful while anything else indicates it failed. 
 Refer to the Realex Payments documentation to get a full list to response codes.

 IMPORTANT: Whatever this response script prints is grabbed by Realex Payments
 and placed in the template again. It is placed wherever the <hpp:body/> tag
 is in the template you provide. This is the case so that from a customer's perspective, they are not suddenly removed from 
 a secure site to an unsecure site. This means that although we call this response script the 
 customer is still on Realex Payment's site and therefore it is recommended that a HTML link is
 printed in order to redirect the customrer back to the merchants site.

NOTE: This link should bring the customer back to a place where an new orderid is
created so that they can try to use another card. It is important that a new orderid
is created because if the same orderid is sent in a second time Realex Payments will
reject it as a duplicate order even if the first transaction was declined.
