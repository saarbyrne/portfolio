                <p>Lily Adong (24) lives in Northern Uganda, in a small village called Mutema. She is a volunteer Independent Resource Tracker, specially trained by ActionAid to help ensure that public funds for local development are being spent in the way that they should. Uganda is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and allocated public services and funds often never reach her remote village. She has a tough job but even though she has only been tracking funds since March 2013 she has already won her first victory.</p>
                            
                <p>In 2012, the community in Mutema had been promised funds from the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF), a programme set up by the Ugandan central government to support communities in Northern Uganda to develop sustainable initiatives.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="column4">
             <p>A local NUSAF lead took up the role to distribute the fund; however, instead of initiating improvements in the village, he started demanding money from the community in exchange for their participation in the programme. This was completely illegal and corrupt!</p>
                        
            <p>Lily Adong comments, <em>"these are poor people and this man was saying 'if you give me money, I will make sure goats, seeds and water will be given to your village,' and people were paying!! These people fight hard to find this money which was anything from 8,000-10,000 shillings (approximately 20 euro). But after money was given to this man the village saw none of the changes promised. It was an outrage."</em></p>
            
        	</div>
        </div>

        <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="column4">
            <p>With the support of ActionAid, a ‘Reflect’ group was set up in Mutema and from the initial meetings of the group, it was clear there were several other cases of corruption. It was discovered that in relation to the re-construction of the community Health Centre, a builder had been chosen but no construction had started. There were also promises of a fresh water system for the village which had never been acted on. Finally, reports also emerged of local health workers stealing medication from the health Centre and selling it illegally. <em>"We sat down and discussed all these cases of local government corruption at the meeting and decided to make a petition,"</em> says Mutema’s ‘Reflect’group chairman, Okello Madakeo.</p>
            
            <p>Lily Adong along with other ActionAid Voluntary Resource Trackers started to detail these cases. In addition, they also undertook a larger investigative study of the development plans for the area. For Lily this was a long and tiresome process as her village is about 40km from the main government offices in the District of Amuru and she had to go there many times by bicycle.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="column4">
            <p>The ‘Reflect’ group delivered a four-page letter signed by 170 people in the community and Lily Adong and five others cycled to the Amuru district headquarters to deliver it. They also sought a meeting with one of the highest officials in the authority, the District Resident Commissioner (DRC). <em>"We waited outside for two hours before we entered. We delivered the signatures and our letter and explained the cases of corruption by local government in our village, "said Lily Adong." During the meeting the District Resident Commissioner actually took out his phone and started to call around to investigate what we were saying to him. We couldn't believe it!"</em></p>
            
<p>Ultimately it was discovered that the person officially contracted and listed to complete the construction work at the Health Centre, was completely different to the contractor chosen by the district council. It was uncovered that the local board of directors of the Health Centre had received a bribe and had instead hired another company who had taken the money and not started the work. Lily Adong and the other IRTs cycled back to the village after their three hour meeting, tired but happy.</p>

            <p>Since then, construction work has begun at the Health Centre, the water pump has been set up and the NUSAF programme lead has since been arrested. Motivated by this success, the group are now working on improving the road to Amuru which will make the journey to their nearest and largest market far easier and shorter.</p>
            
<p><em>"We were blind but now we have the confidence and courage to question where public money is being
spent and my training as a Volunteer Resource Tracker helped me to do this,"</em> said Lily.</p>

<p>Lilly is one of the few to complete secondary school and has very good English. `<em>"I have graduated from school which is not the case for many others girls in my village so I feel it is my duty to do something to
fight this corruption. We need to stand up and fight - if not we will never see the situation change in our village."</em></p>

<p>ActionAid uses the 'REFLECT' methodology all over the world. With ‘REFLECT’ the community comes together to discuss common issues that affect their lives and they are supported to take action to address
these issues.</p>

<p>For example, in 2013, to address low levels of income in Amuru, ActionAid set up Village Savings Groups for female smallholder farmers. This initiative aimed to increase overall household income through the
support of microcredit and savings schemes. Members can save money and borrow from their savings to meet key needs such as their funding their children’s education, paying medical expenses and investing in
small business or seeds to increase crop yield. The best performing savings group in 2013 in Amuru was the “Pajaa Reflect Group” which now has 48 members. Together they saved an incredible Ugx11,913,600/= [€3,504] by the end of December 2013.</p>

            <p>Margaret (33) sits with her newborn daughter outside the Lacor Health Centre III in Amuru town. It’s 11am. Six hours ago she gave birth and an hour later , she was sent out of the hospital ward and asked to sit with the other patients under a big tree just outside the clinic. Some of these patients are pregnant and the rest have new-born babies in their arms. Every morning at 6am they are sent out of the clinic and are allowed back into the ward in the afternoon and that’s only if they have not need sent home in the meantime.</p>
            
<p><em>"Immediately after I gave birth they cut the umbilical cord and I was sent outside, I was so tired after the birth and the walk to get here ",</em> says Margaret. She lives in the village of Toro Camboo, a few kilometres from the Health Centre in Amuru.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="column4">
            <p><em>"When I went into labour, my husband borrowed a motorcycle for us, but it broke down on the road so we were left to walk the rest of the way. I was with my mother in law. When we reached the gate we saw the Health Centre was locked. We stood outside for half an hour before a guard came and opened. I was so afraid of giving birth in the middle of it all. I was in severe pain and the midwife was nowhere to be seen”.</em></p>
            
<p><em>“When I was eventually allowed in, it was actually my mother in law who delivered the baby. It was probably 5am when I gave birth but at 6am we were sent outside again. It was really cold, so I wrapped my daughter in some sheets to keep her warm,"</em> says Margaret.</p>

            <p>Margaret has now seven children. She gave birth to her first almost 10 years ago early one morning, alone in the middle of the road and her other five children were delivered in her small hut at home assisted by her mother in law.</p>
            
<p><em>"You have to have everything with you when you go to the Health Centre to give birth - sheets, clothes, soap - so when I started to have contractions my mother in law went in search of these items while I started to walk on the road to the clinic. My contractions were so strong but I thought it was better that I just went ahead on my own in case I didn’t arrive to the clinic on time,"</em> says Margaret, who never gave a thought to ask her husband Simon to accompany her. In Uganda men never feature in the birth of their children and women are left to look after themselves.</em>

             <h1 class="red">Life is Good When We Have Enough Food</h1>
                <p>Concy Akwero (38) has spent her day harvesting rice. As she painstakingly thrashes each sheath of rice by hand you are brought back to centuries-old farming methods. It's backbreaking and time consuming but this is how women here in Northern Uganda farm.</p>
                
                <p><em>"The harvest is not good this year,"</em> she says, <em>"There is nothing, last year I harvested five sacks, this year I have no more than three small buckets."</em> Compared to a harvest of 500kg last year, this year she has no more that 50 kg of rice to feed her family. The drought this year is causing devastation among the farming community in this otherwise fertile corner of Africa. It's the same story with Concy's bean crop – the yield is simply pitiful.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="column4">
                <p>Besides rice and beans, Concy also grows sweet potatoes, peanuts and millet. The rainy season has just set in and small farmers are praying that the rain continues so their next harvest might be better before the dry season comes again. Concy's husband Patrick trades their surplus grain and otherproduce in the local market in the village. This year most of their harvest will be needed by the family and as rice is four times more expensive outside of harvest season they nearly always feel they are living hand- to-mouth.</p>
                
                <p>Concy has 6 children from a 2yr old to 15yr old including an orphan to take care of. With pride Concy shows us around her kitchen inside the small where her two eldest children sleep. Clothes hang from the ceiling inside the hut. She hopes that she can support her children's education as she herself is illiterate and can't even write her own name.</p>
                
                <p><em>"It's hard to survive mid-season from June to July. During these months we usually only eat once a day in the evening. When we have enough food, we eat twice a day,"</em> says Concy Akwero. It's starting to rain nicely now so we are hoping that this year's drought was a one-off.</p>

                <p>Female smallhold farmers are very effective and are almost fully organic, but they often lack an understanding of trading and business. Last year ActionAid Ireland funded 22 Village Savings Groups which had an average female participation of 85%. The savings groups are aimed at increasing overall household income through the support of micro credit and savings schemes for female farmers like Concy. To strengthen engagement in this programme, in 2013 ActionAid also offered agriculture training using Savings and Credit Cooperatives principles (SACCOs) and 47 leaders from 22 savings groups benefitted from this training in the districts of Amuru and Nwoya in Northern Uganda.</p>

                <p>Only about 10 percent of the land in Amuru is cultivated. During the bloody conflict and war against the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) in Northern Uganda, most of the local population were displaced into refugee camps. During this time, land which had previously been cultivated fell into disrepair and upon returning to the land, the community were faced with a huge task to cut the overgrown bush. 98% of farmers use hand tools to cultivate and clear land. ActionAid supported farmers returning to their land with oxen to assist with the clearing. Groups shared the care of the animals and took turns to plough the fields in advance of planting.</p>

            <p><em>“In all the time I can remember in the village, it was dangerous to cross the river”,</em> says 62-year-old Alex
            Ojera from Oticihi Village in northern Uganda. <em>“We were afraid that our children would be washed
            away during the rainy season, so sometimes we didn’t send them to school and pregnant women could
            not balance on the slippery logs to reach the healthcare”.</em></p>
            
            <p>Previously to cross the river you would have had to walk 100 meters over slippery, muddy logs but now,
            as a result of the new bridge crossing even in the rainy seasons is no longer a problem.</p>

        <div class="column4">
            <p><em>“Things have really improved in the village since it was built”,</em> says Obuti Bosco, who has been a driving
            force behind the building of the bridge.</p>
            
            <p>The bridge is in place as a result of the community coming together to lobby local authorities and to
            demand improved infrastructures for their isolated village.</p>

            always go to school in the rainy season and we’re not afraid that they will be washed away - this
            bridge will save many lives; if our neighbours are sick they can go to the health centre by motorcycle;
            the traffic to and from our village has improved as well and this has also helped trade; for women, it
            has also been easier to go to market with their produce so they sell more and this means more money

            continues, <em>“I am very pleased that we convinced the authorities to build this bridge”.</em> While the
            Department of Engineering paid for the building materials and arranged for food and a small wage to
            be paid, the men in the village came together and worked on it and in the end we built it quite quickly.

           <p>15-year-old Mwaka Santo is pictured here in the village of Otichi where he lives in northern Uganda. He stands in his bare feet. <em>"I want to study and I dream of becoming a pilot."</em> It is unlikely he will get the chance to become one – but if you take away his chance of an education you take away his dreams. Right now he's not in school and it’s not looking like he will be able to return to school. Like many other children living in poverty in northern Uganda, he has to work. Santo works burning trees to make a type of charcoal that he sells to
        support his family and to help save for his education.</p>
        
        <p>It’s hard, dirty work. Like the burning charcoal, his chances of returning to school is disappearing into the warm air of Amuru.
        Mwaka Santo already fears he will end up like one of 100 million young people in southern Africa who are sentenced to a
        lifetime of hard labour, having to live hand to mouth simply to get by.</p>
        
        <p>Amuru has a very young population with those under 18 accounting for 55% of the total population. Usually this would depict a high dependency ratio on the adult population, however, Amurua the case is reversed. As a result of the armed conflict, many adults and parents were either killed or abducted leaving children to turn to relatives for support or fend for themselves in refugee camps.</p>

        <p>In Uganda monthly school fees must be paid. As most families take in relatives, this extra burden of care means only the lucky ones get to go to school – unfortunately Santo is not one of them.</p>
        
        <p>None of Santos siblings have been educated. He still looks to the sky and dreams of life as a pilot. We all have the
        right to an education and the right to dream of a better life. Why should Santos be different?</p>
        
        <p>ActionAid Ireland and ActionAid Uganda are working to ensure that children like Santo will have access to quality
        education. We do this by strengthening the community to demand that governments and authorities are
        accountable to create an education system that is accessible to all.</p>

            <p>This morning, Florence Anzo has walked 25 kilometres with her baby on her back to look for help from
the ActionAid supported Women Protection Centre in Amuru town.</p>

            <p><em>“My children don’t go to school like the other children. I can’t afford it. I’m here desperately looking for
            help”,</em> she says as she sits in the waiting room with her daughter.</p>
            
            <p>Since Florence Anzo first met her husband, he has been beating and threatening her. They met in one of
            the refugee displacement camps that were established as a result of the armed conflict which tore
            northern Uganda apart until 2010. It’s not the first time that Florence has come to the centre in search of
            help. But this seems like the last straw. Her husband and his second wife (polygamy is common in
            northern Uganda) has thrown Florence Anzo and her four children out of their shared home. She is now
            homeless; she has no income or food and is worried about her children as some of them have become ill.
            Moreover she is afraid that her husband will find out where she is and suddenly reappear.</p>

            <p><em>“I am so grateful to the Women’s Protection Center as they make sure that he knows he can’t just show
            up here. Either he must come here in an organised meeting or someone from the centre can relay
            information to him”,</em> explains Florence Anzo breastfeeding little Aciro Wichily whose name means
            “Braved the Pain” in English. Generally children’s names are given based on the circumstance in which
            they were brought into the world.</p>
            
            <p><em>“I was bleeding in the week leading up to the birth and my only outfit was covered with blood. I just
            couldn’t go to the hospital in those clothes”,</em> she explains.</p>

        birth until she finally got help to go to the health centre which is located next to the Women Protection
        Centre.</p>

            <p>The suffering in the life of women and girls' in Northern Uganda is hard for an Irish person to understand. Women are generally married off for their “Bride Price” which is a gift of livestock or money from the groom’s family to the brides in exchange for their daughter’s hand in marriage. As such, women are traditionally considered the property of men and it’s not uncommon that a man will beat their wife. It
is often the girls' and women in the household whose duty it is to ensure the physical hard work is done in the household. When her husband dies, she will often have no have right to own land or to their hut as
this would be passed to her late husband’s family, leaving her and her children homeless, scraping to get by and destined for a life of suffering.</p>
