            <div class="column4">
            <p>“I am Agnes Lalam and I am 9 years old and I live in the village of Ayila with my father Obote 
            Bosco and my mother Ajok Margret. I have 4 sisters and 4 brothers and I go to Gira primary 
            school. I love school and this year I came sixth out of ninety three pupils in my class. 
            My first hen was given to me in 2011 through a scheme run by PCD (Partner for Community 
            Development) and ActionAid. I loved her so much and I used to feed her on maize and 
            sorghum grains every day before leaving for school. After a year, I had 16 baby chicks and 
            my hen was also laying eggs for my family," said Agnes Lalam.</p> 
            
            <p>"Between July and September 2012, I sold nine grown chickens each at 17,000 Shillings or €5 and made a profit of 153,000 Shillings or €45. 
            With my Dad’s help, I used €17.60 of this money to buy a female piglet which grew and gave 
            birth to 6 babies. Sadly, she became a little weak and was not feeding well for 2 weeks. At 
            that time we didn’t have enough money to pay the vet, so my dad and I had to sell her at
            119,340 shillings or €35.10. With this money, my dad was able to buy wholesale groundnuts 
            which are cheap during the harvest season and is now trading them in Labongogali. While 
            I’m looking after the 6 piglets, my dad is using the 119,340 shillings €35.10 in the market to 
            trade. He told me that at the end of the trading season he will have enough money to be 
            able to pay school fees for myself and my brothers and sisters," said Agnes Lalam.</p>
            
            <p>"I thank my sponsor in Ireland and ActionAid for all the help my family has received. When 
            the piglets grow up, I plan to sell them and buy a cow. This will really help my parents 
            because we will be able to sell the milk it produces and in the future my education will be 
            secure.” said Agnes Lalam.</p>

            <p>ActionAid is working hard with school management committees to raise awareness and 
            promote educational rights with a particular focus on women and young girls. We have 
            recently conducted training for 18 senior female teachers who were selected from Guru, 
            Otici, Gira gira, Olwal Mucaja, Ayila and Mutema primary schools. As a follow up to the 
            action plan that was developed during the training, among other initiatives, six hygiene

            hear more about the outstanding work of the senior female teachers in these schools in our
