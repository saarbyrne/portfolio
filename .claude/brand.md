# Saar Byrne Brand Guidelines

## Positioning
Product builder who combines design craft, technical capability, and business instinct. 12 years shipping products in complex domains—from healthcare to elite sports—now focused on early-stage startups where I can own outcomes end-to-end.

## Tone of Voice
- **Confident but not arrogant** - I've done this before, I know what works
- **Direct and decisive** - Founders don't have time for hedging  
- **Practical over theoretical** - "Here's what I built" not "Here's what I think"
- **Collaborative not ego-driven** - "I drove this" not "I'm a genius"

### Examples
- ❌ "I'm passionate about human-centered design and love to iterate"
- ✅ "I ship products that solve real problems"

- ❌ "In my role at Kitman Labs, I had the privilege of working with..."
- ✅ "Led design for NFL teams. Built the rehab feature that became the key differentiator."

## Content Principles
Every touchpoint demonstrates:
- **Building, not just designing** - Show outcomes, not just process
- **Autonomy and ownership** - What I drove, not what the team did
- **Technical + business fluency** - Not just pixels
- **Ready for early-stage chaos** - Comfortable with constraints

## Typography

### Typefaces
- **Work Sans** (sans) 

### Scale
- **Hero/H1**: Work Sans, 48-56px
- **H2**: Work Sans, 32-36px  
- **H3**: Work Sans, 20-24px, semi-bold
- **Body**: Work Sans, 18-20px, line-height 1.6-1.8
- **Captions/UI**: Work Sans, 14-16px

### Rules
- Generous white space between sections
- Max 60-75 characters per line for body text
- Wide line-height for readability

## Color System

### Base Palette (Consistent everywhere)
- **Background**: Off-white/cream (#FDFCFA)
- **Primary text**: Warm black (#1A1A1A)
- **Secondary text**: Mid-gray (#6B6B6B)

### Signature Color
- **Burnt orange/terracotta**: #D2691E or similar
- Used for: Homepage CTAs, links, availability indicators, personal branding elements

### Project-Specific Accents
Each case study uses its own accent color pulled from the project's actual UI:
- Homepage remains neutral
- Project pages use their own color system
- Shows range without feeling scattered

## Visual Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Every element has purpose
- **Space is a feature** - Generous whitespace signals confidence
- **Typography does the work** - Minimal decoration, strong type hierarchy
- **One accent, used precisely** - Not a color explosion

## Brand Aesthetic
**Chimero's curation + Monocle's editorial sophistication**

- Radically simplified structure
- Editorial and substantial when presenting content
- Typography does heavy lifting
- Every piece of writing earns its place
- Quality and sophistication over quantity

## Writing Style
- First person: "I built this" not "this project involved"
- Lead with outcomes, not process
- Show business impact and technical decisions
- Demonstrate autonomy: what I drove, decided, shipped
