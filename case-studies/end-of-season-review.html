            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              As part of work for the Premier League we were tasked with developing an app for youth elite players across the Premier League and English Football League. We created an engaging end-of-season review concept to excite players and help close a critical deal.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              I share this project to highlight a few things:
            </p>
            <ul class="space-y-2">
              <li class="flex gap-x-2">
                <span class="bullet-point"></span>
                <span class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">Design can provide more value than purely user centric design.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="flex gap-x-2">
                <span class="bullet-point"></span>
                <span class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">Design can be at the forefront of client and customer engagement.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="flex gap-x-2">
                <span class="bullet-point"></span>
                <span class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">Design process is not limited to Design Thinking — this project was more art than science.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              This concept was created to support a major Premier League contract negotiation. It needed to showcase modern, innovative, and user-centric thinking while proving we could go beyond the basic requirements to excite young athletes and their coaches.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              The experience was designed to signal that Kitman Labs could balance bespoke needs for a flagship client with scalable product thinking. Although it might never be built, it demonstrated the value of design in shaping business outcomes.

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We conducted 30+ semi-structured interviews across coaches, sports scientists, medical staff, and analysts as part of a generative research track. The consistent theme: players receive dry, decontextualised data that fails to engage them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              Work with the Premier League, MLS, MLS Next Pro, and Aarhus highlighted an opportunity to make feedback inspiring, not just informational. Staff loved that they could upload and visualise performance data, but the player-facing experience lacked emotion and context.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We saw a gap to translate rich staff data into a celebratory, narrative experience that would motivate academy players, reflect their journey, and feel personal. That insight set the direction for the concept.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We also reviewed the previous player overview surface from an acquired vendor. It leaned heavily on attendance-based stats and suffered from patchy data entry—reinforcing the need for a more meaningful, story-driven approach.

              These screen-grabs are of the previous player overview page, used by the vendor Kitman Labs bought, which was often shared with players. It summarises the players stats based on accumulated time, dictated by data driven from calendar event attendance. Apart from the fact that total time is not a great indicator of progress, the inputting of data is often patchy, at best.

              The initial aim was to redesign the old system on our Athlete Mobile App and 'jazz' them up. This, at least, would allow players and their parents to view the players data and hopefully 'engage' them. We were happy to build this, it serves all our customers/users and is generalisable, so a good start.

              But this felt like a missed opportunity, based on the feedback during user interviews. So it was always felt like we could do more, but we werent sure what. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              The idea for the new design emerged from the countless user interviews, all of which were highlighting the mix of ways the clubs were sharing feedback on performance to players, slideshows, pdfs, videos.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              This also came out of necessity. We had a presentation of our findings and designs approaching, but had no 'WOW'. We had done a lot of work on functional staff workflows, all of which was excellent, with some good high level concepts, but for major milestone presentations I find a showstopper is important.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              3 days before in a Manchester hotel room an idea appeared whilst I was doing my Spanish on Duolingo. They had just sent me my end of year review. Spotify had also released a similar concept. Statistics dressed up to look appealing and fun. The idea became easy to develop once I had a trope to piggy back on. Today, this is common. But at the time it was new and hit a note.

              <li class="text-body-lg">Qualitative feedback and encouragement quotes were added, these are low effort additions which have a huge impact, the coaches face is included to reinforce the meaningfulness → "What your coach said about you"</li>
              <li class="text-body-lg">Statistics are important, the right ones though. Session and game attendance can be an issue with players, so I included a reinforcing mechanism, percentage attendance, this is minor attempt to nudge the players to attend, also utilised by staff</li>
              <li class="text-body-lg">The relationship and bond with other players is also called out, each season the player spends every day with team mates and we wanted to capture and celebrate that. Again a simple low effort addition → "Class off '22"</li>
              <li class="text-body-lg">Finally, something very personal was needed, the final section is devoted to images of their achievements, all of which is captured by the clubs, so I dressed that up and made it symbolic. → "Memories" + other uploads.</li>

              When we presented this, along with a number of other designs and plans, contract negotiations on what type of deal and the length of it was still ongoing with the Premier League, it was questionable as to how things would pan out.
