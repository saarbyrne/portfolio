              When we began conversations about building a comprehensive analytics platform for coaching data, we encountered something familiar yet frustrating, stakeholders who couldn't imagine what they couldn't see. They understood the problem, the need for better workforce insights, career pathway analysis, equality and diversity metrics, compliance tracking. But they couldn't imagine what the solution might look like, or more importantly, what value it would deliver. This was an ongoing conversation, I found out later, and had actually started years earlier. The organisations had wanted to look at the topic but couldnt bring themselves together to get organised.

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">We spent a large portion of our time not actually building, but creating a narrative. What story did we need to tell? What interactions would make the value proposition clear? What visualisations would make abstract concepts tangible? We knew the story was just as important as the prototype and the two needed to work together. It was the ratio of time spent on defining and developing which was interesting to me. It far closer to even. I certainly spend more time overall on building, but it was far closer.</p>
            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              Our aim was to push a narratvie but make it engaging and interactive. We framed the aim this way, if a coaching association executive could click through a dashboard and see, in real-time, how career pathways flow from entry-level positions to head coach roles, would that change their understanding of the problem? If they could filter by region, gender, ethnicity, and see the demographic patterns across 8,450 coaches, would that make the need for better data collection obvious? If they could explore data completeness across seven partner organisations with a simple RAG status system, would that demonstrate accountability in a way that spreadsheets never could?

              We created a json file with data that matched the narrative. This gave the narrative a visual backbone and then allowed each dashboard to pull from the same data set, keeping it standardised and clean.

              The conversations have moved forward positively. After experiencing the prototype, the organisations agreed that this data was important to collect. More than that, they committed to a data journey: standardising data collection across the different organisations, ensuring consistency, building the foundation that would make these insights possible. The prototype didn't just demonstrate value; it created alignment around a shared vision of what was necessary. They have also signed contracts with us for long term involvement in the initiative, Kitman Labs will build the dashboards and will push the project forward.

              This is design working at the strategic level, as part of the business and sales process. Design wasn't brought in after the sale was made, or after requirements were defined. It was out in front, working at the earliest touchpoint with a new customer, shaping the conversation, demonstrating possibilities, creating alignment around a shared vision. This gives design a powerful platform within a business, not as a service function that executes on decisions made elsewhere, but as a strategic capability that helps shape those decisions.
