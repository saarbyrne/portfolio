              When we were engaged by the league body of the NFL to build a general purpose EMR for every team in the NFL, this specific topic, Rehab, was identified as the most important with regard to medical staff engagement. In an effort to learn about the topic we arranged a number of working group calls with medical practitioners in the NFL these ran over the course of a number of months.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              As a company, Kitman Labs provides generalised software for all its customers. There is the ability to tweak what is shown and not shown, but customisation is generally kept tight. Thus, in this case we wanted, and it was agreed with the NFL, that we would provide them software but we would retain the ability to make decisions based on our wider user base i.e. soccer, rugby, cycling, cricket, boxing etc.

              We took a decision to work with a broad set of sports and medical practitioners to understand their needs, not just from the NFL, so as not limit the options for our wider user base. In total we talked to 100s of practitioners and went onsite with 15 NFL teams, the IRFU, Chelsea FC and numerous other teams to get feedback on our ideas. This included semi structured interviews, focus groups, onsite walkthroughs and user testing sessions.

              The requirements from the feedback and user research covered so many areas that we wanted a high level prototype to share and get feedback on from all stakeholders before proceeding. This was done with our internal experts who are former/current practitioners and vetted with some 'friendly' users who were willing to give quick and honest feedback. It was also strongly guided by engineering feasibility and our current interaction patterns.

              This has been a huge success. The feedback from NFL staff (we've had multiple, multiple focus group and user interview sessions, along with the league feedback) and the ability to make this generally available to other orgs and clubs has generated lots of interest, engagement and positive feedback. It is a key selling point now when we showcase the product.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              The quantity of requests is a marker of interest and engagement and so that has pushed us to develop a backlog and roadmap for the key items and to tie the rehab area to the wider system ie calendar, our staff mobile app, our athlete mobile app etc.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              In moments like this, when a feature release generates such strong feedback it's important to capitalise and push the advantage, to remove any incumbent competitors and provide even more value. That is what we are trying to do now with this.
