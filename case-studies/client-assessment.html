              As part of a 6 week Design Camp project in Austin I had to research, design and prototype an app for care managers to conduct an assessment. The outcome, though, was about internal change, a better way of working.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We, 4 designers, were tasked with designing a web app for a our core product, Watson Health, which allowed care managers to conduct an assessment of patients (or clients as they are called). It became evident that the business analysts, engineers and the head of design had a general direction already determined. Based on very light knowledge and little to user engagement on either side.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We decided we needed to evaluate those assumptions, so we set about talking to care givers and patients. We cold contacted people on Linkedin, asked friends of friends and pushed our product team to organise people to interview.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              What became critical, as the product team were very confident in their direction, was the need to bring them on the journey. They had never worked with users before, never spent time generally understanding them.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              So, we included a BA or an engineer on every one of our 12 interviews. This was really the biggest win. The team bought into the process after the first interview. They clearly saw the benefits. It also changed the direction of the app, moving to a mobile and tablet first approach.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              Below is a general documentation of the linear steps. But for me the main outcome and why I am sharing this piece is to highlight the need to show and not tell, to bring people on the journey and not expect them to just believe blindly in your process.

              A Care Manager must go to an individual's (patients) home and try to conduct an assessment in 45 minutes. On average, these assessments take about two hours. And should be done by two care workers.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              As part of the research we interviewed 12 caregivers of varying experience levels and determined this issue, of conducting two hour assessments with someone the caregiver may have never met, and who probably mistrusts the caregiver, to be the major problem. We researched and looked at the breakdown of a number of different assessments to understand the content finding that the assessments are long winded and could easily be partially automated or reduced in size.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We also found many care workers would go to the house and be so tired from constantly doing these assessments that they read from a piece of paper and never tried to build trust with patients, leading to a horrible experience for both patient and care worker.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              As part of the project, there would be a number of playbacks. These were large scale presentations back to all of the academy and every designer at IBM Austin. Here would showcase findings, learnings, direction and designs. The deck included was the final deck shared at the last playback.

              As the assessment is holistic, it tries to investigate all areas of a patient, from physical, environment, risk and many other areas, we felt that the trust factor was imperative to conducting a quick and honest assessment.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              The aim was to have the care worker arrive on time, in a good state and informed of the patient. We also wanted to have the care worker have a proper conversation with the client and build trust, instead of having their head buried in a piece of paper.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              We looked at utilising many 3rd party products for doing the physical assessment and looked to leverage an IBM voice to text product to allow for the capturing of the assessment results. Thus, the assessment would be recorded and transcribed with semantic analysis allowing for little to no extra work or the care worker.

              Presenting work in the form of a narrative can drive a lot of buy in, specifically if you can showcase a thorough understanding of the problem space. We did that in this deck. All major work we did at IBM invloved Playbacks and alignment.

              It may just seem like a deliverable here as part of this portfolio piece, but due to the internal team never having worked in such a way, this showcased not only great work, in terms of research and thought, but showcased a way of working that had much more emphasis on providing good quality product that meets users needs.

              The work shown was done in the space of a few weeks with little to no access to customers or users provided by the business. They came to us with a problem and they had a vague idea of what they wanted but they had never worked with users in so much depth, the general way of working would have been to go straight into design work and talk to the 1 in house 'expert' on the subject.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              What we did, by organising 11/12 different semi structured interviews and bringing them along to the interviews, was take them on the journey of user research enlightenment.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-800">
              After 1 interview the BAs and engineers, saw the benefit of this user engagement. They actually became hooked on it and it spurred a whole user research hiring spree for Watson Health. The outcome here, and why I share this piece, is to not only showcase work but to highlight how bringing someone on a journey can act as a strong catalyst for change.
